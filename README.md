## Usage

The extension is enabled by default when you open VS Code. It will randomly add comments to your code as you type. The chance of gaslighting increases late at night because that's when you make the ~~worst~~ best decisions.

## Commands

- `syntax-gaslighting.toggle`: Toggles the extension on/off
- `syntax-gaslighting.editChance`: Edits the chance of gaslighting
- `syntax-gaslighting.resetStreak`: Resets your gaslighting streak counter
- `syntax-gaslighting.randomMessage`: Shows a random gaslighting message (for when you're not feeling bad enough about your life decisions)

## Severity Levels

- **Mild**: Light yellow underline for minor gaslighting
- **Medium**: Orange underline for moderate questioning of your abilities
- **Severe**: Red underline with light background highlight for code that's truly special

## Language Support

Enhanced gaslighting messages for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C#
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- Go
- Ruby
- Rust
- And more generic messages for all other languages
